# Supporting Distressed Coworkers

The training office has a page for [assisting a distressed trainee](https://www.training.nih.gov/assisting_the_distressed_trainee). Especially since we're at NIMH,
we should all look out for each other. You can read that page to
better learn to recognize signs of distress.

That page also includes phone numbers and links to critical resources that are provided by NIH. They also have printable papers and wallet cards if you want to keep the info easily on hand. Since that information gets updated, it's worth getting it from that site rather than here, but here are the key resouces we all should be aware exist:

- [Training office](https://www.training.nih.gov) Career services |  Educational counseling & advising.
- Confidential access to mental health professionals through the [Employee Assistance Program](https://ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/EAP)
- [Civil program](https://civilworkplace.nih.gov) for reporting harassment and other things
- [NIH Ombudsman](https://ombudsman.nih.gov)
- [Occupational Medical Service](https://ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/HealthAndWellness/OccupationalMedical/Pages/oms_main.aspx) for medical emergencies including abrupt behavioral changes
