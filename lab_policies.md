# Lab-specific and NIH Policies

Below, we have links to our lab policies. We include general NIH-wide policies (including COVID guidance and general recommendations on supporting distressed co-workers), and SFIM specific policy, such as our Data and Code Policy.

## COVID Guidance

There is currently a masking requirement in Building 10. Please see our specific page on [COVID Guidance][covid_guidance] for more information on making policies, what to do if you test positive, or any other questions about our COVID policy.

## Supporting Distressed Co-workers

As a lab, we hope to be able to support and look out for each other to encourage a safe and positive work environment. In our page on [Supporting Distressed Co-Workers][supporting_coworkers], we provide resources for well-being, in addition to critical links and phone numbers for critical resources at the NIH.

## Data and Code Policy

As part of our Data Management and Sharing plan (and federal policy), we have committed to making our data and code publicly available. Please see our [Data and Code Policy][data_code_policy] for specific details about how we implement this.
