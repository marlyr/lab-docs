# Resources regarding COVID at NIH

NIMH leadership has been very clear that no one should be required to be a situation where they feel uncomfortable due to COVID risk or other issues. If you are asked to be in a situation where you would feel uncomfortable, please contact Peter, Dan, and/or Javier. If someone tells you they are uncomfortable, either remove the source of discomfort or allow them to leave without consequences.
