# How To: Start a Study

Here, we give a broad overview on how to start a study.

1. Request space on Biowulf to store data and code

    Data and code should be stored on Biowulf, rather than your local laptop. To keep things organized, put in a request to the HPC team for a new directory. Make sure that it's name begins with "SFIM_" and ends with something descriptive. Ensure that Staff Scientists and the Scientific Programmer, in addition to any other SFIM collaborators who are working on the project have access to this directory.

2. Set up your codebase

    Once you have a dedicated space on Biowulf, start setting up your codebase. Please see the [How to: Set up and use a GitHub repo][use_github] for how to set up a GitHub repo for your project. Also consider meeting with a Staff Scientist or the Scientific Programmer to plan out what a codebase can/should look like.

3. Collect and analyze your data

    This can look different depending on whether you're working on an acquisition or analysis-based study.

    If you're working on an acquisition based study, you will want to collaborate with the FMRIF Core to develop sequences. Especially during early stages, make sure you look at your data as you collect it. The AFNI team has worked on some cool tools for [quality control][afni_qc] to help you explore your data and make sure everything is working as you expect it to.

     If you're working on an analysis-based study using data we already have on Biowulf (or if it's a dataset curated by DSST), you can just get started on your analyses. If not, ...

4. Get your data and code ready for sharing

    Once you've finished your analyses and written up a manuscript, get ready to share your data. Check out our Data and Code policy and the [How to: Get your data and code ready for publication][share_data_code] for details.
